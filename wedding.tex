\section{Definition of Marriage}
\midaligned{\em /* I, the great dateless wonder, will proceed to school you two on the meaning of marriage.}
\midaligned{\em Contrary to popular believe, It's serious business! */}
\blank[big]
Officiant: 
\startnarrower Marriage is perhaps the greatest and most challenging adventure of human relationships. No ceremony can create your marriage; only you can do that – through love and patience; through dedication and perseverance; through talking and listening, helping and supporting and believing in each other; through tenderness and laughter; through learning to forgive, learning to appreciate your differences, and by learning to make the important things matter, and to let go of the rest. What this ceremony can do is to witness and affirm the choice you make to stand together as lifemates and partners.

``Oh the Places You'll Go''
by Dr Seuss

Congratulations! Today is your day.
You're off to Great Places! You're off and away!
You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes.
You can steer yourself any direction you choose.
You're on your own. And you know what you know.
And YOU are the couple who'll decide where to go.
You'll look up and down streets. Look 'em over with care.
About some you will say,``We don't choose to go there.''
With your heads full of brains and your shoes full of feet,
You're too smart to go down, any not-so-good street.
And you may not find any you'll want to go down.
In that case, of course, you'll head straight out of town.
It's opener there in the wide open air,
Out there things can happen and frequently do
to people as brainy and footsy as you.
And when things start to happen, don't worry. Don't stew.
Just go right along. You'll start happening too.

OH! THE PLACES YOU'LL GO!

You'll be on your way up! You'll be seeing great sights!
You'll join the high fliers who soar to great heights!
You won't lag behind, because you'll have all the speed.
You'll pass the whole gang, and you'll soon take the lead.
Wherever you fly you'll be best of the best.
Wherever you go, you will top all the rest.
Except when you don't. Because sometimes, you won't.
You'll get mixed up of course, as you already know.
You'll get mixed up with so many strange birds as you go.
So be sure when you step.
Step with great care and great tact
and remember that Life's a Great Balancing Act.
Just never forget to be dexterous and deft.
And never mix up your right foot with your left.
And will you succeed?
Yes! You will indeed!
98 and ¾ percent guaranteed.

We have no need of words, you and I
heart speaks to heart while we are close together;
but I also need to say that I love you:
I must express my feelings and show you how much I care.

My heart won't need words to talk to you, my God:
and you don't speak in sentences but in a twinkling as quick as a thought;

nevertheless, words can express my worship:
if I speak with you for a second, I may need hours to prepare for it.

I long to be conscious of your real presence:
to be aware of your attention to me in a moment of time.

Yet as soon as you are with me, I have to turn away from you:
a glimpse of heaven makes me want you to send me to hell!

\section{Support of Community}
\midaligned{\em /* Optional - Sort of replaces ``objections from the audience time'' */}
Officiant:
\startnarrower Two people in love do not live in isolation. Their love is a source of strength with which they may nourish not only each other but also the world around them. And in turn, we, their community of friends and family, have a responsibility to this couple. By our steadfast care, respect, and love, we can support their marriage and the new family they are creating today.
\stopnarrower
\startnarrower Will everyone please rise.

\midaligned{\em /* The good sheeple rise, I am their master */}

Officiant: 
\startnarrower Will you who are present here today, surround Jason and Laura in love, offering them the joys of your friendship, and supporting them in their marriage?
\stopnarrower
All: 
\startnarrower We will
\stopnarrower

\midaligned{\em /* Yes my minions, YES. Do as your master commands! */}

Officiant:

\section{Wedding Vows}
\midaligned{\em /* Really big show, really big! */}
Officiant: 
\startnarrower We've come to the point of your ceremony where you're going to say your vows to one another. But before you do that, I ask you to remember that love – which is rooted in faith, trust, and acceptance - will be the foundation of an abiding and deepening relationship. No other ties are more tender, no other vows more sacred than those you now assume. If you are able to keep the vows you take here today, not because of any religious or civic law, but out of a desire to love and be loved by another person fully, without limitation, then your life will have joy and the home you establish will be a place in which you both will find the direction of your growth, your freedom, and your responsibility.
\stopnarrower
Officiant:
\startnarrower Please now read the vows you have written for each other.
\stopnarrower
\midaligned{<<Insert vows>> Love, cherish, respect, blah... blah... blah...}

Officiant: 
\startnarrower May I have the rings, please?
\stopnarrower
Officiant:
\startnarrower Please repeat after me: {\em I give you this ring, as a daily reminder of my love for you.}
\stopnarrower
One and then the other:
\startnarrower I give you this ring, as a daily reminder of my love for you.
\stopnarrower
Officiant: 
\startnarrower By the power of your love and commitment, and the power vested in me \footnote{by the Intertron}, I now pronounce you husband and wife! You may kiss each other!
